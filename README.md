====================

Let’s play with Magic Squares. The rules are simple.

For a given number, output a magic square where numbers in all rows, 
columns and both diagonals sum to the same constant.  For example, 
solving the problem for the number 3 would generate a square where the 
sum calculated in any direction would equal 15.  

2  7  6 
9  5  1 
4  3  8

Solving for 5 might render the following where all combinations add 
up to 65:

23  12  01  20  09
04  18  07  21  15
10  24  13  02  16
11  05  19  08  22
17  06  25  14  03

What I like about the problem is there’s some math, it’s solvable and 
it should act as a stepping stone to solving harder problems like Sudoku.  
And, believe it or not, you can find information about magic square at
